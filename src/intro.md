# Introduction

## What I am aiming for

I am setting out to build my own programming language before Advent Of Code 2023.
The language will be inspired by what I have learnt and seen other languages implement and I will be stealing heavily from languages I like.

Anytime you see things written in italics consider it me having a conversation with myself and not final.

## High level goals

- Write a treesitter parser
- Implement a dynamically typed functional imperitive language
- Implement a runtime / virtual machine
- Implement message passing and lightweight processes
- Implement a compiler
- Have a working toolchain
- Write a LSP

## Unlikely / Non goals
- Full functional static upfront type system
- Haskell
- Purity
- High performance
- Manual memory management
